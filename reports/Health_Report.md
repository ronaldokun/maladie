### Key Findings:

**1. Acute Hepatic Crisis (September 12, 2025)**
Your most recent blood work shows a dramatic deterioration in liver function markers, with what appears to be a severe hepatobiliary crisis. This coincides precisely with your reported symptoms of fatigue, inflammation, excessive urination, and diarrhea.

**2. Cholestatic Pattern**
The elevation pattern suggests cholestatic injury (bile duct inflammation/obstruction) rather than pure hepatocellular damage, which is consistent with PSC exacerbation. The disproportionate rise in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) compared to transaminases is classic for biliary tract pathology.

**3. Post-Infectious Complications**
The timeline is critical here:
- **August 5-14**: Cholangitis hospitalization (bacterial infection of bile ducts)
- **August 31**: C. difficile infection with UC flare
- **September 12**: Acute decompensation

This sequence suggests you may be experiencing:
- Recurrent cholangitis or incomplete resolution of the initial infection
- PSC stricture progression triggered by recent infections
- Post-infectious inflammatory response affecting both IBD and PSC

### Possible Explanations:

1. **Recurrent Ascending Cholangitis**: The sudden enzyme elevation with systemic symptoms strongly suggests another episode of cholangitis, possibly due to bacterial seeding during your recent infections.

2. **Dominant Stricture Development**: PSC can develop dominant strictures that cause acute obstruction, leading to the dramatic enzyme elevations you're experiencing.

3. **Drug-Induced Hepatotoxicity**: If you received antibiotics for C. diff (likely vancomycin or fidaxomicin), there could be a component of medication-related liver injury, though this seems less likely given the cholestatic pattern.

4. **Overlap Syndrome Flare**: The combination of UC flare and PSC exacerbation can create a severe inflammatory cascade affecting multiple organ systems.

### Prognosis and Recommendations:

**Immediate Concerns:**
- The multi-fold increase in liver enzymes with systemic symptoms suggests active biliary sepsis or severe cholestasis requiring urgent intervention
- The fluid shifts (edema followed by diuresis) suggest possible hepatic decompensation

**Short-term Prognosis:**
With appropriate treatment, acute cholangitis typically responds well to antibiotics and biliary drainage if needed. However, given your recent infection history, you may need:
- Extended antibiotic therapy
- MRCP or ERCP to evaluate for dominant strictures
- Possible biliary intervention (stenting/dilation)

**Long-term Considerations:**
- Recurrent cholangitis episodes accelerate PSC progression
- Your young age at diagnosis (20) and now 20 years of disease duration puts you at higher risk for cirrhosis and need for transplant evaluation
- The recent pattern of infections suggests your disease may be entering a more aggressive phase

**URGENT: You should seek immediate medical evaluation, preferably at a center with hepatology expertise. The combination of markedly elevated liver enzymes, systemic symptoms, and your PSC history warrants urgent assessment for cholangitis and possible biliary intervention.**
